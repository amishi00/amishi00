## 👩‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 I'm a junior studying Computer Science + AI at Cornell. I am really passionate about creating something end-to-end and learning new technologies to be applied to fields such as healthcare and sustainability.
- I have interned at **Amazon** and **Echo3D** as a SWE intern before but am currently open to roles in full-stack development, Machine Learning + AI, and Data Science.
- In college, I am a part of Cornell Nexus where I am making an autonomous robot to collect microplastics, Cornell Tech Consulting, and KTP Tech Fraternity where I mentor new members in all areas of tech.
- 🤖 Recently, I’ve been exploring:
  - Machine Learning, AI + Robotics + Computational Genetics
- 🍔 In my free time, I love dancing on Cornell Nazaqat, trying out different matcha shops, watching rooftop sunsets, and ranking restaurants on Beli!
